In this project, I set out to strengthen my SQL analysis skills using a comprehensive Spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of information about songs, artists, and musical attributes, making it an ideal foundation for end-to-end data exploration. It includes essential track-level details such as song names, artists, albums, release dates, duration, and popularity scores. Additionally, it features genre classifications and audio characteristics

Beyond individual songs, the dataset also provides valuable insights into broader music trends. It highlights genre and category distributions, artist performance patterns, collaboration frequency, playlist behavior, and seasonal listening tendencies. These diverse features open the door to analyzing relationships between musical attributes and popularity, identifying top-performing genres and artists, understanding how song duration affects engagement, and even experimenting with basic recommendation techniques.

The goal of this project is to use SQL as the primary tool for extracting insights, identifying patterns, and answering complex questions about the modern music landscape. By performing queries involving aggregation, filtering, joins, and exploratory analysis, I aim to uncover meaningful trends within the Spotify ecosystem. This project not only demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets but also strengthens my analytical thinking, data storytelling, and technical skills in SQL-driven data exploration.
